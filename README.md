# Repair Website

The Repair website is a project I developed as part of my practice in writing jQuery scripts. It's a simple website designed for a construction company to showcase their services and projects.

## Key Features

- **jQuery Scripts**: I implemented jQuery scripts to enhance the functionality and interactivity of the website, such as smooth scrolling, image sliders, and form validation.

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.

- **Simple and Clean Layout**: The layout is kept simple and clean to prioritize ease of navigation and focus on essential information.
